Concepts
API:
Application Programming Interface

REST:
Representational State Transfer is an arquitecture
they make use the resources -based on url's end point 
they use http methods(get post delete put)
they use http status code(200 ,400 etc)

HTTP Methods
POST: Create a and store something
GET: Reading or retrieving a list of things
PUT: Update or editing and existing thing
DELETE: Delete something

To post and get we use the same url http://www.ninja.com/api/ninjas
to put and delete we can use the same url http://www.ninja.com/api/ninjas/id

how we handle a http request
app.method_name(router(could be /, /ninjas ect), callback(req,res){
	body .....
})
example 
app.get(/api, function(req, res){
	res.send(Hola mundo);
});

Middleware is all the code in between the input and the output
body-parser access to the request's body , parse it and anttached to the request letting us to have access to the data coming in the request's body
